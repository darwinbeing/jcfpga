Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
WARNING:Place:1206 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <PLL_250_INST/clkout2_buf>, driving the net, <CLOCK_250>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: COUNT_CLK_P.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <PLL_250_INST/clkout2_buf.O> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN.
WARNING:Place:1206 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <PLL_250_INST/clkout1_buf>, driving the net, <CLOCK_100>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.

WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design

   net, <CLOCK_250>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load
   pins.
   < PIN: COUNT_CLK_P.O; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <PLL_250_INST/clkout2_buf.O> allowing your design to continue. This

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
